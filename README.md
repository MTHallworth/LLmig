# LLmig: Migration schedules from Light-level geolocators

The LLmig package is a single function package that uses the output from the estelleMetropolis     
function in the SGAT package to determine migration schedules from light-level geolocator data.     
Stationary periods are determined using natural changes in longitude and latitude through the use    
of changepoint analysis. Stationary periods encompass location uncertainty associated with light-level     
geolocation.
